# 🗜️ CryptoZip

CryptoZip is a C++-based data compression and decompression tool that implements the **LZ77 compression algorithm**, optimized with **KMP string matching** to find repeated sequences efficiently. Ideal for compressing large text files with high redundancy.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔁 **LZ77 Compression**
- ⚡ **Efficient pattern matching** using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm
- 💾 Binary file output with `<distance, length, nextChar>` tuples
- 🔄 Decompression engine to restore the original file
- 📊 Shows compression ratio and time taken
- 🧠 Modular code (separated into `src/` and `logic/` directories)
- 🚀 Written entirely in modern C++

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

You need a C++ compiler (like `g++`) and Make.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awaisAhmed19/CryptoZip.git
cd CryptoZip
make
````

This will generate the `main` executable.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📦 Compression

```bash
./main
```

By default, this:

* Reads from `bigfile.txt`
* Writes compressed data to `compressed.lz77`
* Logs compression stats

### 🔓 Decompression

Add the decompression function call inside `main.cpp`:

```cpp
decompressLZ77("compressed.lz77", "decompressed.txt");
```

Then recompile and run to restore the original file.

## 📊 Compression Stats Example

```bash
Original Size:     235838 bytes
Compressed Size:   153121 bytes
Compression Ratio: 0.649
Time Taken:        320 ms
```

*Stats vary depending on file redundancy and window size.*

## 🔮 Future Plans

* 🧩 Add Huffman encoding for nextChar
* 🔒 Integrate simple XOR encryption
* 📦 Build `.czip` custom file format
* 🌐 Web-based UI using WebAssembly (long shot, but cool)
